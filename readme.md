# Overview
This mod adds a planner tool that automatically color-codes pipes based on their contents. The planner tool can be accessed via a shortcut button or invoked by pressing alt+p

----------
# Features
- Select an area to color-code any pipes, undergrounds, pumps, and storage tanks within it
- Reverse select an area to remove any color and return the pipes to their base versions
- Two color matching modes: Best Guess mode attempts to match the fluid to a standard rainbow color (currently vanilla only), and Perfect Match mode uses pipe colors that exactly match the color of the fluid (compatible with all vanilla and modded fluids)
- By default the planner marks the pipes for upgrade, requiring bots to come "paint" them. This can be overridden with a per-player mod setting to instantly paint pipes instead
